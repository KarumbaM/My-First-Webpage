"Watcher Films", will require a server environment so that it can run smoothly but it does not require one to install any dependancies.

## Known Bugs
Currently there are a few bugs in the code used in developing "Watcher Films" leading to some pending issues as it awaits debugging.

The main issue that would impact the use of "Watcher Films" is its sudden collapse while still in use but we are working extra hard to correct the problem.

We intend to reduce its bulkiness and automate its data storage as those are some of the workarounds that we discovered to be the solutions that help it recover from the malfuntioning behaviour.
## Technologies Used
Python is the major programming language that we used to come up with "Watcher Films".In addition to that, Visual Studio Code also contributed about 90% in the well being of our application as it was the best developer tool that we used to come up with the application.
